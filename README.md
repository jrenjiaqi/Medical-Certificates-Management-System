# Medical-Certificates-Management-System

## About the Project
This is a simple Medical Certificate (MC) Management System built with Vue and Laravel.

It aims to centralise and streamline MC collection from army personnel within military camps and bases. 

This platform enables the personnel to submit their details, as well as a document of their medical certification. These entries can then be viewed, edited, and deleted.

### Acknowledgements:
This project was coded-along to the following [Vue-Laravel online tutorial](https://youtu.be/2gUezppbcNI). No code was provided by the tutorial. 

All code where replicated had been done so after understanding the tutorial and attempting to replicate the process on my own, with the aim of gaining insight to Vue and Laravel.

To demonstrate this project is largely a learning process to gain exposure to Vue and Laravel, and that most of the code was adapted from the above online tutorials, the stylings of the project has been kept largely identical to the online tutorial.
