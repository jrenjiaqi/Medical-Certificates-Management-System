# Medical-Certificates-Management-System

## About the Project
This is a simple Medical Certificate (MC) Management System built with Vue and Laravel.

It aims to centralise and streamline MC collection from army personnel within military camps and bases. 

This platform enables the personnel to submit their details, as well as a document of their medical certification. These entries can then be viewed, edited, and deleted.
