# Medical-Certificates-Management-System

## About the Project
This is a simple Medical Certificate (MC) Management System built with Vue and Laravel.

It aims to centralise and streamline MC collection from army personnel within military camps and bases. 

This platform enables the personnel to submit their details, as well as a document of their medical certification. These entries can then be viewed, edited, and deleted.

### Acknowledgement and Disclaimer:
This project was adapted from a coded-along to the following [Vue-Laravel online tutorial](https://youtu.be/2gUezppbcNI). 

No code was provided by the tutorial itself. All code where replicated have been done so manually, after gaining an understanding into each step of the web app.

For a project where I have made original inputs to website styling, please visit the [OurSGHeritage website clone](https://github.com/jrenjiaqi/OurSGHeritage-Govtech-Website-Clone), where I renovated [OurSGHeritage's website](https://www.oursgheritage.gov.sg/)
